Silverstripe Project Management by titledk
==========================================

A simple project management system, built in Silverstripe.
This is a fully functioning project management system for a 1-man company.
It's built in a couple of days, out of the need for a PM system


Requires Silverstripe 2.4

I hope this serves some inspiration for others working on Silverstripe PM solutions. For now development is on standby, but if you're interested in contributing, please send a pull request.
